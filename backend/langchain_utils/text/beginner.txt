['Absolutely',
 "I'd be happy to guide you through creating a simple smart contract using "
 'Solidity! Solidity is a programming language designed for developing smart '
 'contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. \n'
 '\n'
 'Before we dive in',
 "let's clarify a couple of terms:\n"
 '\n'
 '- **Smart Contract**: This is a self-executing contract with the terms of '
 'the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of '
 'code. It can automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement.\n'
 '- **Solidity**: This is the most popular language for writing smart '
 'contracts on Ethereum.\n'
 '\n'
 'Now',
 "let's create a very simple smart contract that allows us to store and "
 'retrieve a number.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Step 1: Setting up the Development Environment**\n'
 '\n'
 'To write Solidity code',
 'you need an environment to compile and deploy your smart contract. For '
 'beginners',
 'I recommend using Remix',
 'which is an online IDE with a built-in Solidity compiler and Ethereum '
 "simulator. It's very user-friendly for beginners.\n"
 '\n'
 'Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your web browser.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Step 2: Writing the Smart Contract**\n'
 '\n'
 'In Remix',
 'create a new file with a `.sol` extension',
 'for example',
 '`SimpleStorage.sol`.\n'
 '\n'
 "Here's a simple smart contract in Solidity:\n"
 '\n'
 '```solidity\n'
 '// Specifies the version of Solidity',
 'using semantic versioning.\n'
 '// This contract is written for Solidity version 0.8.0 or greater.\n'
 'pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n'
 '\n'
 "// Define a contract named 'SimpleStorage'\n"
 'contract SimpleStorage {\n'
 '    // This will be stored permanently in the blockchain\n'
 '    uint storedData;\n'
 '\n'
 '    // Function to store a number\n'
 '    function set(uint x) public {\n'
 '        storedData = x;\n'
 '    }\n'
 '\n'
 '    // Function to retrieve the stored number\n'
 '    function get() public view returns (uint) {\n'
 '        return storedData;\n'
 '    }\n'
 '}\n'
 '```\n'
 '\n'
 'Copy and paste this code into the Remix editor.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Step 3: Compiling the Smart Contract**\n'
 '\n'
 'In Remix',
 'go to the Solidity compiler tab on the left side of the screen and click the '
 '"Compile" button. If there are no errors',
 'your contract is now compiled and ready to be deployed.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Step 4: Deploying the Smart Contract**\n'
 '\n'
 'To deploy the contract',
 'switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix. Make sure '
 '"JavaScript VM" is selected as the environment',
 'which simulates an Ethereum blockchain. Then click the "Deploy" button. Your '
 'contract is now deployed on the simulated blockchain.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Step 5: Interacting with the Smart Contract**\n'
 '\n'
 'After deploying',
 'you can interact with your contract. You should see your deployed contract '
 'under the "Deployed Contracts" section. Here you can call the `set` function '
 'to store a number and the `get` function to retrieve it.\n'
 '\n'
 'For instance',
 'enter a number into the `set` field and click the button to store it. Then '
 'click the `get` function',
 'and you should see the number you stored.\n'
 '\n'
 "Congratulations! You've just created and deployed a simple smart contract "
 'using Solidity. This contract is very basic',
 'but it demonstrates the fundamental principles of how smart contracts are '
 'written',
 'compiled',
 'and interacted with on the Ethereum blockchain.\n'
 '\n'
 'As you get more comfortable',
 'you can start adding more complex logic and state variables to your '
 'contracts. Solidity supports various data types',
 'control structures',
 'functions',
 'and inheritance',
 'similar to other object-oriented languages',
 'allowing you to build sophisticated decentralized applications.']
