Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe table that might contain information about conversation status is likely to be `conversation_session`. I should check the schema of this table to understand what columns are available, especially looking for a column that might reference topic names and a timestamp or date column to identify the most recent conversation status.

Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe `conversation_session` table contains a column `topic_name` which is likely to hold the names of topics from conversations, and it also has a `created_at` timestamp column that can be used to determine the most recent conversation status. I should now write a query to select the `topic_name` from the `conversation_session` table, ordered by the `created_at` timestamp in descending order to get the most recent conversation status, and limit the results to at most 10.

```sql

```[0m
Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThe query checker has confirmed that the query is correct. Now I can run the actual query to get the topic names from the most recent conversation status.
